# Statistical Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves generating a synthetic dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical testing to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis includes advanced data visualization techniques and statistical annotations.

### Data Generation

- `Value`: Random floats representing a continuous variable.
- `Group`: Categorical variable with three levels (A, B, C) used for grouping data.
- `Category`: Categorical variable with three levels (X, Y, Z) representing different categories.
- `Numeric`: Random integers simulating a count or measurement.

### Visualizations and Analysis Performed

1. **Pairplot**: Visualize pairwise relationships, distinguishing data points by group.
2. **Heatmap**: Show correlations between numerical variables.
3. **Boxplot**: Display distributions of a numerical variable across different groups and categories.
4. **Statistical Test**: Apply the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there are differences between two groups.

### Results

- The pairplot may reveal distinct clusters or correlations specific to groups.
- The heatmap provides insight into how variables relate to each other.
- The boxplot illustrates variations within and between groups and categories.
- The Mann-Whitney U test determines if the difference between two groups is statistically significant.

### Project Significance

The techniques demonstrated in this project are widely applicable in data science for initial data exploration and hypothesis testing. The project is beneficial for data analysts and scientists looking to understand the data before applying more complex models.

## How to Run the Code

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
- Install required packages using `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy`.
- Run the script in a Python environment or Jupyter notebook.

## Potential Beneficiaries

- **Data Scientists/Analysts**: For EDA before model building.
- **Academic Researchers**: To analyze experimental data.
- **Business Analysts**: To derive insights from business metrics.
